git config --global user.name "your-github-account-name"
adding first commit
Add some file and add some data or data in README.md. Save the file
git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
git add file-name-you-have-update
git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   README.md
Check logs before commit: git log --oneline
Commit changes: git commit -m "my first commit"
Check the logs again there is a new entry
Check status again
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
In order to add or commit the file in single command use:
git commit -am "updated the steps for activity 1"
updating code in the remote repository
git push origin main
There is a concept/feature in GitHub to block direct PUSH to the protected branches and all changes should route via Pull Request

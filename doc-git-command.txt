adding first commit
Add some file and add some data or data in README.md. Save the file
git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
git add file-name-you-have-update
git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   README.md
Check logs before commit: git log --oneline
Commit changes: git commit -m "my first commit"
Check the logs again there is a new entry
Check status again
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

nothing to commit, working tree clean
In order to add or commit the file in single command use:
git commit -am "updated the steps for activity 1"
updating code in the remote repository
git push origin main
There is a concept/feature in GitHub to block direct PUSH to the protected branches and all changes should route via Pull Request

Working with branches
Create new branch with latest version of current branch: git branch feature-1
Switch to the new branch: git switch feature-1
